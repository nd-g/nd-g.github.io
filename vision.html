<h4 style="font-family:verdana;"> Hi everyone! This page is about the scope of the DateaDeafie project, what it is now and what it hopes to become!</h4>

<hr class="rounded">
<h5 style="font-family:verdana;"> What is DateaDeafie? </h5>
<p style="font-family:verdana;"> As of right now DateaDeafie is a general directory for local Deaf events. However it is also a general project to make the Deaf dating and dating in the Deaf world/while Deaf easier! This means it is going to become an ASL based dating app where our accessability needs are adequately met in a dating space. This means that we will strive to create an experience that is uniquely Deaf-based.</p>
<br>
<p style="font-family:verdana;"> This page will be regularly updated to log what steps have been taken on the project and will update more if we find funding.</p>
<br>
  <p style="font-family:verdana;"> Also because I'm an artsy type I will include one of my favorite albums to end off this update</p>
