<p>These are the areas that I have studied in, I had a bit of an atypical childhood so I have had exposure to many areas that are very different from each other.</p>
<p>Many people call me a jack/jill of all trades, I can offer expertise in a multitude of areas</p>
</section>
<section class="third-content-box">
<h2>Theology</h2>
<p>I consider myself a theologian, I have studied theology academically at Gallaudet University. Topics that I am well versed in include Christian Mysticism, Hussitism, and I also study Entheogenic influences on abrahamic religious practices. Other religious movements I personally study include Taoism and LaVeyan Satanism. My theological views are very progressive and my framing of theological topics is progressive. This does not mean I do not believe non-progressive framings are invalid, it simply means that I personally do not adhere to them.</p>
<p>Additionally, I strive to foster interfaith engagement when speaking with my peers about spirituality. This allows for greater critical thinking and also diversity in thought. By understanding all the perspectives there are out there on theology I am able to have a more nuanced understanding of theology as a whole. I love interfaith discussions, they are what I live for in the theology scene.</p>
<p> Additionally I believe God affirms Queer identity, this point is pretty fundamental to my understanding of faith and how to live a 'Godly' life.</p>

<h2>Public Health</h2>
<p>In addition to Theology, I also studied Public Health at Gallaudet University. In this sector I focus on sexual wellness and how best to inform others about the topics of safe sex. Many people have a lack of understanding about sexual education due to not recieving enough resources educating them on the matter. I hope to seek to change this and educate others about sexual education as well as helping others to have a better understanding of anatomy and bodily functions.</p>

<section class="third-content-box">
<h2>Women's Studies</h2>
<p>I have an associates of arts in Womens Studies from Sacramento City College. This means I recieved an education on feminist movements from the 1920s to the present era. Additionally to this I learned how the systems we participate in are inherently patriarichal. This degree taught me just how recent concepts such as Womens Rights are. Womens Studies has helped me be better informed about Womens issues in the US and abroad, I am very thankful for this degree!</p>

<section class="third-content-box">
<h2>Geneology</h2>
<p>Outside of work I do a lot of geneology work! This includes working with Gramps, familysearch, and Ancestry.</p>
<p>This means I can find hundreds of years worth of family records to help people better understand their roots and the culture of their ancestors</p>
<p>This is very helpful in situations where perhaps a family followed a certain religious practice for hundreds of years and were later forced to assimilate. Or perhaps for someone that doesn't know much about their family past their grandparents.</p>

<section class="third-content-box">
<h2>Silversmithing</h2>
<p>I am a silversmith by trade, I did silversmithing with my grandparents growing up and learned how to make silver rings and necklaces.</p>

<section class="third-content-box">
<h2>Geology</h2>
<p>In addition to learning how to silversmith with my grandparents they also taught me how to be a 'rockhound' this means I can find rocks and minerals in the wilderness and desert and use those rocks to make jewelery.</p>
</section>
<section class="third-content-box">
<h2>Computer Science</h2>
<section class="third-content-box">
<h2>Ubuntu</h2>
<p>When I use computers outside of work typically I do not use Windows or Mac but rather Ubuntu. This means I have skills in troubleshooting as well as problemsolving as Ubuntu is a more complex operating system than Windows or Mac. I can set up systems with open source software that does the same thing as the leading paid software on Windows.</p>
</section>
<section class="third-content-box">
<h2>HTML</h2>
<p>I have skills in building basic HTML websites, I am training in Full Stack Development right now to develop web apps and also am learning to use CSS to make more advanced websites.</p>
<p>Right now I am also working on the <a href="http://dateadeafie.com">dateadeafie</a> project which seeks to create a more accessible Deaf dating experience</p>
