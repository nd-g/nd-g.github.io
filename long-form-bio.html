<h2>Geneology</h2>
<p>Outside of work I do a lot of geneology work! This includes working with Gramps, familysearch, and Ancestry.</p>
<p>This means I can find hundreds of years worth of family records to help people better understand their roots and the culture of their ancestors</p>
<div></div>
<p>This is very helpful in situations where perhaps a family followed a certain religious practice for hundreds of years and were later forced to assimilate. Or perhaps for someone that doesn't know much about their family past their grandparents.</p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<h2>Silversmithing</h2>
<p>I am a silversmith by trade, I did silversmithing with my grandparents growing up and learned how to make silver rings and necklaces.</p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<h2>Ubuntu</h2>
<p>When I use computers outside of work typically I do not use Windows or Mac but rather Ubuntu. This means I have skills in troubleshooting as well as problemsolving as Ubuntu is a more complex operating system than Windows or Mac. I can set up systems with open source software that does the same thing as the leading paid software on Windows.</p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<h2>HTML</h2>
<p>I have skills in building basic HTML websites, I am training in Full Stack Development right now to develop web apps and also to use CSS to make more advanced websites.</p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<h2>Geology</h2>
<p>In addition to learning how to silversmith with my grandparents they also taught me how to be a 'rockhound' this means I can find rocks and minerals in the wilderness and desert and use those rocks to make jewelery.</p>
